Flask + React.js + Webpack example
##################################

clone the repo and cd into it, then install the javascript dependecies with
npm::

    npm install

then install the python dependecies::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

then you may run webpack to build the javascript assets::

    npm build 

which just runs `webpack`, and then run the flask::

    npm serve

which just runs `python app.py`
  

Congratulations!
